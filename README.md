# Gulp Task Arsenal

After spending too much time organising my `gulpfile.js` and reorganising old tasks every time I had a new project, I found out that the best way to organise gulp tasks is to keep them in separate files and use another file to keep all project paths. This way I can just add or remove task files without needing to change anything in the code.

In this repository I keep tasks that make my life easier, and that I often find myself using again and again. Being able to just drag and drop them is particularly sweet. Please feel free to contribute with tasks that you also find useful.  

## How does it work?
It's all done using `gulp-organiser` a super simple organisation module.
